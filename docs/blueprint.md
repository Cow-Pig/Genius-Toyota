# **App Name**: Toyota Finance Navigator

## Core Features:

- Initial Onboarding Modal: A desktop-friendly modal for initial user onboarding that captures ZIP code, credit tier, down payment/trade-in, monthly budget, preferred terms, and annual mileage via sliders, numeric inputs, and stepper buttons.
- Affordability Card: Displays a large monthly estimate with a slider and input to adjust the budget and a donut chart breaking down principal, interest, taxes, and fees.
- Finance vs. Lease Comparison: Compares financing and leasing options in two tiles, showing payment, due at signing, total over term, and a plain-English verdict. Clicking a tile opens a Math Drawer.
- Math Drawer: A drawer that appears when you click the tile allowing editable line items such as MSRP, incentives, taxes, APR by credit tier, term, residual percentage, and money factor, with labeled sample rates and formulas (PMT for loans; depreciation + rent charge for leases).
- Model Suggestions: Suggests car models filtered by affordability cap with photo cards, key specs, estimated payment, and badges (Hybrid, AWD, Safety Sense). Fuel-spend estimates (Eco vs Gas) will be provided via AI tool.
- Scenario Tray: A tray pinned at the bottom allows users to compare up to three saved configurations side-by-side with a table and a small cumulative cost chart, mileage calculator.
- Export and Share: Generates a one-page PDF with hero image, payments, breakdowns, and QR code. Supports sharing a link to the scenario.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Restrained red (#E23428), derived from Toyota's brand, conveys trust, strength and passion, providing subtle yet confident call-to-actions.
- Background color: Clean white (#FAFAFA) provides ample negative space and establishes an airy feel for a clean desktop-first presentation.
- Accent color: Dark Gray (#4A4A4A), an analogous hue pulled from the darker end of Toyota's branding palette, is chosen as a professional and restrained highlight color.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for both body and headlines to ensure a modern, machined, objective, neutral look, and great readability on desktop screens.
- Desktop-first layout optimized for large screens (1440px baseline) with a three-column grid: left summary rail, central simulation canvas, and right discovery rail.
- Subtle micro-interactions to provide delight without distracting the user: hover states, slider ticks, animated number transitions, and drawer transitions.
- Simple, geometric icons will be used. Color is to be used minimally within icons, using mainly gray (#4A4A4A) and a desaturated red (#E23428).
